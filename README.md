### The course Applied Photovoltaics is a laboratory course that provides hands on exercises in photovoltaic (PV) module fabrication and characterization. I presented with the theory behind the most commonly used PV characterization methods in PV research and industry. Hands on characterization of PV devices will be performed in the lab and in the field, including measurements of the deviceâ€™s electrical, thermal, and optical characteristics. Furthermore, I performed three different PV imaging techniques and will be able to differentiate each technique with its distinctive advantages when analyzing PV failures; the imaging techniques include thermography, electroluminescence and photoluminescence. Some of these characterizations and imaging techniques will be performed on a mini PV module that is designed and built by my group. I got acquainted with techniques for measuring the solar resource and analyzing field performance data. The course primarily focuses on crystalline silicon devices.
